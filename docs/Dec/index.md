# December Documentation

In December, the project shifted focus from infrastructure setup to **project planning, access management, and user-centered configuration**.  
Work concentrated on defining a clear project plan with sprints, restricting app visibility, and creating user groups on the YunoHost server.  
These efforts laid the groundwork for accessibility-focused system design and future evaluation.

Detailed notes and progress are organized week by week in the following sections.
