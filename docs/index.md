# Disabled Data Sovereignty Documentation

This documentation is part of the **IVE Project on Disabled Data Sovereignty**,  
supervised by **Dr. KJ Hepworth**.

## ðŸ“– About This Project
This project investigates how disabled people and communities can exercise  
**control over their own data (data sovereignty)** in ways that are **accessible, inclusive, and practical**.  

Many existing self-hosting tools (like Yunohost) are designed for technically skilled users,  
which creates a barrier for disabled people who may face **accessibility challenges, technical barriers, or exclusion from digital sovereignty movements**.  

To address this, the project:  
- Experiments with **accessible self-hosting** using Yunohost as a starting point.  
- Reviews and tests Yunohost applications for **search accuracy, categorization, and accessibility**.  
- Documents the process of setting up and maintaining a **local server** with simplified, guided steps.  
- Aligns the work with **international accessibility standards** (such as WCAG) to ensure inclusivity.  
- Engages with the **Yunohost community** to share findings, propose improvements, and build awareness.  

The long-term vision is to prototype an **accessible self-hosting framework**  
that empowers disabled people to own, manage, and protect their data without relying on inaccessible or overly technical infrastructures.
