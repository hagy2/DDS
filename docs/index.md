# Disabled Data Sovereignty — Documentation

Welcome! This documentation records my work on the **Disabled Data Sovereignty**  
project, carried out as part of the **IVE program** and supervised by  
**Dr. KJ Hepworth**.

The project runs from **September to February**, is hosted on **Hetzner Cloud**,  
and is designed to be **accessible, inclusive, and engaging**.  
It draws inspiration from **Yunohost**  but is tailored  
to be more user-friendly and less technical, with a strong focus on  
**accessibility compliance** (WCAG 2.1 AA standards).
