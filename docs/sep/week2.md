## üìå Notes
- **Setting up a Lenovo PC:**  
  Followed instructions here: [How to Boot a Lenovo ThinkStation from a USB Drive](https://codingmall.com/knowledge-base/25-global/11961-thinkstation-boot-from-usb)  

- **Flashing software ISOs to USB:**  
  Using FOSS Software Etcher in admin account of another computer. The process fails unless you are logged into an admin account.  

- **Installing Yunohost 12.12**  
  I tried installing Yunohost first, it failed part way through. Installing Yunohost was only successful after installing Debian first. It seems to be something about how the Lenovo PC interprets the formatting of the USB drive. Some USB drives/flashed ISOs are read by the BIOS as 'UEFI', some as 'Legacy', some appear as two drive options ie 'UEFI' and 'Legacy.' Choosing a 'UEFI' drive results in successful installation, chosing a 'Legacy' drive results in a failed install.
