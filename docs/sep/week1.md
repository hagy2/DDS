# Week 1 â€” September

**Summary:**  
This week focused on setting up the foundation for the project.  
creating the cloud environment, researching documentation approaches,  
and reviewing accessibility standards to ensure the project starts on  
an inclusive path.

---

## âœ… Tasks Completed
- **Created VM in Hetzner Cloud**  
  Set up a virtual machine on Hetzner to host the project infrastructure.  

- **Researched Yunohost documentation**  
  Studied how Yunohost organizes its guides and documentation structure  
  to learn from their approach while planning a more accessible version.  

- **Created static documentation site**  
  Initialized GitHub Pages with Jekyll and Cayman theme to start building  
  static documentation divided by months and weeks.  

- **Reviewed accessibility compliance standards**  
  Went through **WCAG 2.1 AA** guidelines and accessibility best practices  
  to guide the design of the docs (clear navigation, high contrast,  
  screen reader support, and simple language).

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- The structure will mirror Yunohostâ€™s clarity but remove heavy technical jargon.  
- Accessibility will remain a **priority from day one**, not an afterthought.  
- Static documentation setup in GitHub Pages provides a lightweight,  
  user-friendly way to share updates.
