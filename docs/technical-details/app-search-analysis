# Analysis of YunoHost App Search (Demo)

## 1. Categorical Filtering (by category in catalog)

### Synchronization
- Apps found: calendars, file sharing, password managers.  
- Mostly relevant. Categories are clear.  

### Publishing
- Apps found: e-commerce, CMS, blog/wiki engines.  
- Matches expectations.  

### Communication
- Apps found: IRC server/client, Matrix clients, chat tools, webmail.  
- First result lacked a clear description. Some overlap with *Office* and *Messaging*.  

### Office
- Apps found: note apps, encrypted docs, stock management, diagramming, office suites.  
- Some apps (comic strip tool, stock management) feel loosely related → may confuse users.  

### Productivity and Management
- Apps found: finance, CRM, database managers, scheduling, maps, feedback tools.  
- Broad but relevant to productivity.  

### Social Media
- Apps found: federated social networks, reading/sharing, YouTube alternatives.  
- Category feels well-structured.  

#### Conclusion on Categories
- Categories work, but there’s some overlap and inconsistencies:  
  - *Office* vs *Productivity* sometimes redundant.  
  - *Communication* contains apps without clear labels.  
- Descriptions could be clearer to help new users.

## 2. Keyword Search (by typing in search bar)

### Email
- Results: temporary email tool, invoicing software (with email), groupware.  
- Mixed quality: not all results are about email clients.  

### Mail
- Results: webmail clients, help desk, newsletter managers.  
- More accurate than “email.”  

### Webmail
- Results: only actual webmail clients.  
- Very precise.  

### Calendar
- Results: Feber (group calendar).  
- Only one app showed → missing others like Nextcloud.  

### Events
- Results: none.  
- Missed expected matches (e.g. calendar/event tools).  

### Contacts
- Results: SOGo (groupware with contacts).  
- Limited but relevant.  

### Files / Drive / Storage
- **Files:** mix of file servers + unrelated (Hat.sh encryption, MiniDLNA).  
- **Drive:** Nextcloud, ownCloud, Seafile.  
- **Storage:** only one app (Armadietto).  

### CRM
- Results: CiviCRM only.  
- Narrow, missed other CRM-like tools.  

### PKM (Personal Knowledge Management)
- Results: none.  
- Missing hits like Outline, Cryptpad.  

### Knowledge
- Results: Cryptpad, Outline.  
- Accurate, but inconsistent with “PKM.”  

### Chat / Messaging / Matrix
- Results: broad set of clients and servers, including Matrix and XMPP.  
- Generally accurate.  

### Docs
- Results: collaborative editors (CodiMD, Collabora).  
- Good match.  

### Password Manager
- Results: KeeWeb.  
- Only one → Vaultwarden missing.  

#### Conclusion on Keyword Search
- Works well for very precise keywords (*webmail*, *drive*, *docs*).  
- Generic terms (*email*, *files*, *storage*) return mixed or incomplete results.  
- Missing mappings:  
  - *Events* → no apps found.  
  - *PKM* → no apps found, though apps exist.  
  - *Password manager* → only 1 app, incomplete.  
- Suggests that metadata tags in app catalog need review/standardization.

## Overall Findings
1. Categories are broad but useful. Some apps are misclassified (*Office* vs *Productivity*).  
2. Keyword search depends heavily on exact terms → synonyms don’t always map.  
   - Example: “webmail” works, “email” gives messy results.  
   - “PKM” is not recognized, but “knowledge” works.  
3. Descriptions are inconsistent: some apps (like IRC-related ones) lack clear explanations.  
4. Users may struggle if they don’t know the “right” keyword.
